<p><i><font face="courier new" color="blue">Remember when 
<br>I was young and so were you
<br>And time stood still and love was all we knew
<br>You were the first, so was I
<br>We made love and then you cried

<p><u><font face="tahoma" color="red">Remember when
<br>We vowed the vows and walked the walk
<br>Gave our hearts, made the start, and it was hard
<br>We lived and learned life threw curves
<br>There was joy, there was hurt

<p><b><i><font face="tahoma" color="green">Remember when
<br>Old ones died and new were born
<br>And life was changed, disassembled, rearranged
<br>We came together, fell apart
<br>And broke each other's hearts

<p><u><i><font face="harrington" color="orange">Remember when
<br>The sound of little feet was the music
<br>We danced to week to week
<br>Brought back the love, we found trust
<br>Vowed we'd never give it up
