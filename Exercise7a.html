<h3 id="BARKO"> TITANIC </h3>
<img src="titanic.jpg" height=30% width=20% style="float: left" hspace="20">
<h4>The movie tells the dramatic story of the Titanic with Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet as the main actors.
In the year 1912 a young poor guy, Leonardo, travels by the gorgeous ship Titanic from London to New York 
with a big dream. On board he meets a fabulous, wealthy girl, Kate Winslet.
Titanic" is an epic, action-packed romance set against the ill-fated maiden voyage of the R.M.S. 
Titanic; the pride and joy of the White Star Line and, at the time, the largest moving object ever built. 
She was the most luxurious liner of her era -- the
"ship of dreams" -- which ultimately carried over 1,500 people to their death 
in the ice cold waters of the North Atlantic in the early hours of April 15, 1912.

<h3 id="DRAGON"> HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON: Snoggletog Log </h3>
<img src="dragon.jpg" height=30% width=20% style="float: left" hspace="20">
<h4>The special opens on the Haddock family in their living room and Hiccup preparing to light the fire.
Zephyr and Nuffink run off to feed the dragons while Astrid says she's going to go make some Yaknog and steps off screen. 
Unable to get the fire started, Hiccup grumbles until a fireball flies in from the right and ignites the wood in the fireplace. 
Hiccup thanks Astrid for starting the fire, and steps off screen. Snow can be seen falling through the windows. 
Gobber soon appears and puts a cauldron of his mutton soup on the fire for Snoggletog dinner. 
As it's cooking, characters step on and off screen.

<h3 id="RH"> RUSH HOUR </h3>
<img src="rh.jpg" height=30% width=20% style="float: left" hspace="20">
<h4>Cultures clash and tempers flares as the two cops named Detective Inspector Lee a Hong Kong Detective and 
Detective James Carter FBI, a big-mouthed work-alone Los Angeles cop who are from different worlds
discovers one thing in common: they can't stand each other. 
With time running out, they must join forces to catch the criminals and save the eleven-year-old Chinese girl
of the Chinese consul named Soo Yung.
This movie is pure comedy from the beginning to the end. 
You will have a good laugh thanks to Chris Tucker in his role of Carter, 

a clumsy LA cop. The city of Los Angeles is spectacular and is a great scenario for this entertaining movie. 
Jackie Chan at its best kicking asses everywhere with an outstanding humble attitude. 
I think Americans love Jackie Chan because he's so nice and great person.

The main reason why I like this movie is the wonderful duo they play, 
constantly arguing, while walking around exciting California, USA, about everything, 
but in the meantime they are loyal partners. The great diversity there is in America singles out in a city 
like Los Angeles when we go through Chinatown. And fortunately, the movie brings us out there. 
Interesting cultures melt into a huge variety of ethnicities that make anything possible to happen. 
This is why America is so interesting and wonderful and we from abroad love her as a beautiful land.

<h4>Two professors team up to locate a lost treasure and embark on an adventure that takes them from a Tibetan ice cave to Dubai, and to a mountain temple in India.

Chinese archeology professor Jack (Jackie Chan) teams up with beautiful Indian professor Ashmita and 
assistant Kyra to locate lost Magadha treasure. In a Tibetan ice cave, 
they find the remains of the royal army that had vanished together with the treasure, 
only to be ambushed by Randall (Sonu Sood), the descendent of a rebel army leader. 
When they free themselves, their next stop is Dubai where a diamond from the ice cave is to be auctioned. 
After a series of double-crosses and revelations about their past, 
Jack and his team travel to a mountain temple in India, using the diamond as a key to unlock the real treasure.
